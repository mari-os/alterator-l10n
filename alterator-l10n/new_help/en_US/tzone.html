     <h2>Time zone</h2>
     <p>A <strong>time zone</strong> is a region of the earth that has uniform standard time,
     usually referred to as the local time.</p>

     <p>There are two main clocks in a Linux system:</p>

     <p>The Hardware Clock: This is a clock that runs independently of any control
     program running in the CPU and even when the  machine  is  powered off.</p>

     <p>The System Time: This is the time kept by a clock inside the Linux kernel
     and driven by a timer interrupt. It has meaning only while Linux is running on the machine.</p>

     <p>Every time Linux starts up, it will synchronize System Time with Hardware Clock.</p>

     <p>Turned on "Hardware time set to GMT" flag indicates that the Hardware Clock 
     is kept in Coordinated Universal Time, otherwise it is kept in local time</p>

     <p>If you want to have automatic Daylight saving time (DST) support then you should to turn on
     "Hardware time set to GMT" flag. But if you have Windows system installed on your computer,
     then you should to turn off this flag.</p>
