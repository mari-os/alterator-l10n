        <h2>System administrator</h2>
	<p>Any Linux system has a special user account reserved for a system administrator.
	Standard name for this account system is "root".
	</p>
	<p>Please remember password for this user especially if it was automatically
	generated. It will be prompted  if you will decide to
        change some system settings , e.g., to add new user accounts, to configure
        network or to install additional software.
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyone who knows system administrator's password has unlimited access
	to your system. You can damage your system by mistake, working as a system administrator.
	Therefore, you should always work as a normal user, and
	switch to root only for administration tasks.
	</p>
