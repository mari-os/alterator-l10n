    <h2>Backup schedule setup.</h2>
    <p>You only need to specify a backup start time. Backup type will be choosen automatically:
      <ul>
        <li>Incremental backup at every day of workweek (from monday to saturday);</li>
        <li>Full backup at every first sunday of the month;</li>
        <li>Differential backup at every 2nd, 3th, 4th, and 5th sunday of the month.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Bacula is a very smart backup system.
       It will automatically made a full backup instead of incremental or
       differential if no previous full backup was not found.</p>
    <p>Please note, that a real backup time depends on some factors, e.g., network bandwidth.</p>
