    <h2>System update</h2>

    <p>New versions of software installed in your system release every day.
    There are security updates or improved sofware with  new features.</p>

    <p>If you choose mode "Update system automatically from Internet", then you
       should implicitly specify update source. In mode "System update managed by server"
       update source will be calculated automatically. In this case you must have
       an ALT Linux server in your LAN.</p>

    <p>You should also specify repositories for updating.
    Please note that different repositories have different stability.
    More stable repositories typically contain older versions of software.
    </p>

    <p>System update will start automatically according to specified schedule.</p>
