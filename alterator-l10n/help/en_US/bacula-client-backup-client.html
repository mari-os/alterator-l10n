    <h2>Client's setup</h2>

    <p>You should install bacula client on each machine you want to backup and then register it on using this screen.
       For each client you must specify:
       <ul>
          <li>Client's name. This is an any symbolic name you want;</li>
          <li>Client's address;</li>
          <li>File set for backup. Initial file set depends
              on operation system profile that you've selected during client creation (Linux or Windows).
          </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>To made your life easier we've prepared a config file for each client.
       You can simply download it and apply to client's file daemon.
