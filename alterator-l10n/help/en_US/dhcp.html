    <h2>DHCP server</h2>

    <p>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - protocol used by client to
    obtain automatically an IP address from reserved address range and also some useful 
    information about local network (DNS-server, search domain, default gateway).</p>

    <p>Typically the obtained address is valid for a limited period and can be 
    later reused for another client.
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes it is useful to give same IP-address every time client connect to network.
    In this case server can recognize client using hardware address of network adaptor (MAC address).
    You can add a such clients to the table with <em>Static addresses</em>.</p>

    <h2>Dynamic DNS</h2>

    <p>DNS (Domain Name System) -  protocol to establish a relationship between human-friendly
    symbolic names and IP addresses.</p>

    <p>In some distributions you can find a DNS-server in pair with DHCP-server.
    This server works automatically without any additional configuration and supports DNS-zone with name equal to 
    the server domain name (see module "Domain"). This server will work only with 
    statically (not DHCP or Zeroconf) configured network interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>In this case:
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamically allocated address will automatically registered in DNS with name equal to the client computer name</li>
        <li>Table with static address will automatically mapped to DNS (if computer name was specified)</li>
        <li>DNS-server and it's domain will automatically sended to all network clients.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Attention:</strong> DNS-server's database will be reset if you change domain name or 
    change some static IP-address. List of static DHCP addresses will also be removed in this case.
