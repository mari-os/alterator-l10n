     <h2>Caching proxy server</h2>
     <p>Users of corporate networks usually are connected to the Internet
     through a single channel. 
     When a proxy server is placed at the entrance to the network (on the <em>gateway</em>), web
     pages obtained through it are stored in the cache, and subsequent requests
     to the same pages need no download. This will significantly speed up acces to the most
     popular Web sites and reduce <em>traffic consumption</em>.
     </p>
     <p>Add address and the port which the server should <em>listen to</em>
     and enter them in your browser settings. Leaving the address empty connections
     will be accepted at all available addresses.
     </p>
     <p>Proxy can be used to restrict user access to the Internet.
     To allow a network segment to use the server, add it's
	 <em>range of addresses</em>, such as 192.168.1.0/24, to the settings.
	 Acces for out of range clients will be denied.
     </p>
     <p>In case of refusal user will be issued with an error page describing
     the reason and contact information, in particular, server administrator's
     <em>Email</em>.
     </p>
     <p>The <em>domain</em> of local websites could be omitted, in which case
     it will be <em>appended</em> automatically. Set domain in the form
     .domain.org. Site names without dots are considered local.
     </p>
     <p>
     Doubtful web-sites can be blocked having listed them in the corresponding list.
     </p>
     <p>Immediately after installing proxy, it may not be running. Please follow
     <em>start, stop or restart service</em> link and run it.
     (There you can see its current state as well.)
