    <h2>Proxy-server</h2>

    <h3>Proxy-server configuration</h3>

    <p>A local network of computers can be connected to the
    global network (Internet) via a single data transmission channel
    (<em>gate</em>). One of the advantages of that networking solution
    is the possibility of use the caching proxy-server to cache incoming
    files. Popular pages would be cached at first visit, saved and
    reused responding to later requests. That would speed up request
    processing and reduce the amount of incoming <em>traffic</em>.</p>

    <p>Proxy-server listens to the incoming requests from the local
    network and, if necessary, transmits them to the outer network.
    Server waits for the incoming connection on the configured
    <em>port</em>, which by default has standard value 3128. If for some
    reason the use of that port is unwanted, any another value can be
    used.</p>
    
    <p>Source address of each request is checked for internal network
    membership. In order to forward the local network-originated
    requests the corresponding network address group should be added
    to the list of internal networks (subnet address and address mask)
    at the <em>Networks</em> section.</p>
    
    <p>An other restriction under which the request is forwarded is
    the <em>destination port</em> range. If the destination port number
    of the request is not contained in one of the registered port range
    the access to the outer network is denied. The list of registered
    port numbers (services) can be managed in the <em>Ports</em>
    section.</p>

    <p>Proxy-server can operate in two modes: <em>standard</em> and
    <em>transparent</em>. Standard mode implies (manual) reconfiguration
    of the programs in the local network. For that reason the other mode
    -- transparent -- became very popular. In transparent proxying mode
    all local network-originated requests sent to the registered
    services (ports) on the global network are automatically intercepted
    at the gate. Local network programs continue to work without any
    reconfiguration as there is no proxy at all. The main drawback of
    the transparent mode is the lack of any user identification
    mechanism -- all of the requests are anonymous.</p>

    <p>The main advantage of the standard proxying mode which can be
    used after reconfiguration of the programs in the local network are
    a number of user authentication mechanisms. To enable authentication
    select one of the <em>authentication methods</em> other than "no
    authentication".</p>

    <p>Outer network access policy consists of an authentication policy
    (method) and a number of user group based domain access policies.
    Use the <em>Groups</em> section to view and edit that
    policies. For each group of users a number of restricted
    (or allowed) domains can be defined. For the user group membership
    management system-wide module "Users/Groups" can be used.</p>

    <h3>View proxy-server statistic reports</h3>
    <p>Information on every request forwarded to the outer network is
    fixed in the proxy-server log. That statistical data is processed 
    on a regular basis to emerge traffic reports. The reports include
    information on size of received responses and time consumed.
    The reports are accessible in the <em>Statistics/Proxy-server</em>
    module.</p>

    <p>If one of the authentication method was used to control network
    access the reports are generated on per-user basis. Otherwise the
    local network address is used as request identifier.</p>

    <p>With regular and intensive usage of global network, the amount
    of statistical information grows enormously. To make the reports
    more readable and to save disk space the values are averaged as they
    get old forming the four report detail levels: <em>today</em>,
    <em>last week</em>, <em>last month</em> and the summary.</p>

    <p>Report calculation consumes time and system computational
    resources. Because of that the reports are not updated in realtime
    but periodically. The update period can be selected for 5 to 45
    minutes. To update the reports on demand the <em>Update now</em>
    button can be used.</p>
