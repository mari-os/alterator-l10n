     <h2>Mailing list server</h2>
     <p>The more participants involved in the e-mail, the more difficult to list them.
     Often the <em>mailing list server</em> does the job. You can create and manage
     mailing lists with it via the web. Subscribers are able to modify their subscription options and toggle
     delivery, list administator&nbsp;&mdash; to change common list settings, add or remove subscribers.
     </p>
     <p>
     Each list has an <em>URL host</em>, where it can be customized,
     and an <em>Email host</em> (or domain), through which messages will
     be sent. These addresses can be either entered manually or determined automatically.
     </p>
     <p>
     From the list of installed mail servers you should choose the
     <em>Site MTA</em>, and from the list of languages&nbsp;&mdash; the
     <em>Site language</em>. Language for each list can be specified further.
     Create the <em>default site list</em> and enter it's name. It is proposed to write on
     technical matters.
     </p>
     <p>
     Along with the list administrator passwords, you can use a common
     <em>administrator password</em>. To create new lists via web-interface&nbsp;&mdash;
     a <em>list creator password</em>. Set them in the settings.
     </p>
     <p>
     Sometimes, it is useful to keep multiple virtual domains with mailing lists assigned
     to them on a single host. Add the necessary domains or remove unnecessary.
     </p>
     <p>Immediately after installing mailman, it may not be running. Please follow
     <em>start, stop or restart service</em> link and run it.
     (There you can see its current state as well.)
